If models need to be constructed, then welcome to _knowledge represenation_ and
_knowledge acquisition_.

Models have to run and we need to be able to:

- control (some) of their inpiuts;
- score (some) of their output

If there exists any doubts about what inputs might be seen, welcome to _sensitivity analysis_.

If there is doubt about some of the  internal details of the  model, welcome to _qualitative reasonong_.

If output scores contradictory, welcome to _multi-objective reaoning_.

If there are many outputs, you have an  _explanation_ problem.

If outputs are not linear on the input, welcome to _meta-heuristic search_.

If outputs are slow to score, welcome to _active learning_.


Each of the above areas is its own sub-field that can boast a truly  vast literature.
That said, they may be unexplored synnergies between them all. For example, _active learners_
prune away examples that are too similar to prior examples
